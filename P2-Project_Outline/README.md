## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I plan on creating a logbook / supply management application for immunotherapy compounders (or, the 'mixing nurse' as we call them in our clinic). 
It will track supplies in stock (and where they are ordered from), generate a list of supplies that need to be ordered soon, as well as log patient recipes and compounding dates.
It will help keep the mixing nurse organized and on top of supplies they need, as well as make it easier to pull up information about extracts.
I am one of the mixing nurses at my clinic, and for years I have always wanted an application that helped us keep track of our mixing more easily.
### Features
Users will be able to create and authenticate accounts.

Users will have CRUD functionality for managing extract supplies, as well as patient recipes & mix dates.

Users will be able to create posts with description of what was last done.

Users will be able to generate a list of extract supplies (master list, need-to-order list, active extract vials list).

Users will be able to search for extracts & patient recipes.
